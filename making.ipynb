    "The commodity trading seminar was the brand new seminar from the Erasmus University Rotterdam during the 2017-2018 academic year. During the seminar, students learned about how the commodities, mainly agricultural products, were trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope was wide, and the curriculum covered not only for studying research papers but also for analysing actual commodity prices. My group chose the coffee price, especially the Robusta coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "My role was managing data for forecasting the prices of Robusta with other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the forecastings were done using STATA because of the statistical advantages of STATA. I used python for preprocessing and cleaning our data set.\n",
